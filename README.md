Thank you for the applause, but you're not supposed to do that. Now, so I think, again, ask-- Jared makes a good point. Most minimum wage workers think it's a good thing. They won't if they lose their jobs, though. They're not experts in economics. They're not experts on thinking about how their businesses might respond. We're here to have a discussion and to think about these ideas. And again, ask yourself-- ask for your children, those of you who have children, would you want your child to go out into the workforce being only told they can only get a job if they can make at least $15 an hour or $20 an hour, or 25? $7.25, it turns out, not such a big hurdle, because 80 percent of teenagers are able to earn that anyway on top of it.
